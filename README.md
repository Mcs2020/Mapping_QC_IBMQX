# Mapping Quantum Circuits to IBM QX Architectures
---

### This notebook is a demonstration of the mapping for any Quantum Circuit to IBM QX architecture in quantum computing using qiskit. It was used in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8382253). 

I illustrates the two steps that are required for the mapping from this paper using qiskit. Tha mapping process is then can be entered to A* or genetic algorithm to perform more optimization. The proposed approach is able to determine a mapping for quantum circuits within seconds in most cases whereas IBMâ€™s solution requires more than 1 h to determine a solution for several cases. This method has many advantages and in the upcoming notebooks, I shall implement some important applications.
